<div class="entry-content"><p>It was a day when I was in high school. I was having a Math class. I got bored so I went for a chat with my next-desk friend. We were chitty chatty quietly but eventually the teacher got us. Let&#8217;s call the teacher Yuan. She got us probably because we sat in the front of the classroom, so what we have done really disturbed her. She got so angry and wanted us to meet her after class. She used to be a nice and easy teacher. It was perhaps we talked too much and we have talked on every Math class before.</p>

<p>So after class we went to the teacher office to meet her. My friend and I stood there nervously, right in front of teacher Yuan while she was sitting at her desk trying to pretend she was mad about us. I knew that because I knew her. The tension was released a bit, no one got pulished. My friend stood aside me is a funny boy, that&#8217;s why we often talked on class. He found that Yuan was not that angry so he started to say something funny. I don&#8217;t remember what he said, but I do remember very clearly what was happened next. Because I was so released so I laughed so hard that a black/yellow bogus was shot out of my nose right to Yuan&#8217;s jeans.</p>

<p>One second of silent at that office, then my friend explode to laugh. I felt so embarrassed that I was trying to wipe that bogus off Yuan&#8217;s jeans. However that bogus was not completely dry. It was a little sticky, like a half ripe rice with a hard core. So all I was doing was not wiping it off, but spreading it all over Yuan&#8217;s knee.</p>

<p>My friend almost died that he leaned himself on the side of the desk. I wanted to laugh too, but I knew that it was not appropriate because I am the one that spread that bogus. I slowly raised my head, facing Yuan&#8217;s face which is mixed with all kinds of emotions: fury, but holding laugh. Then I stopped wiping.</p>

<p>As I remembered, that was the only right thing I did in that office that day.</p>
